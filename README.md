# swag_labs-manual-testing

This project contains a set of manually written test cases for the Swag Labs application (https://www.saucedemo.com), a widely used demo platform for practicing software testing.  
The purpose of the project is to evaluate the functionality of the Swag Labs login module by designing and executing structured test cases based on real-world QA standards.

The test cases cover both positive and negative scenarios, including valid login behavior, invalid credential handling, input validation, and error message verification.  
Each test case is documented with clear steps, test data, expected results, actual results, and execution status to ensure full transparency and traceability.

This project serves as a learning and portfolio-building resource for QA enthusiasts, helping them demonstrate test design skills, documentation practices, and understanding of functional testing workflows.
